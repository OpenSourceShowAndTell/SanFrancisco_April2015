  <h3>What is Open Source Show &amp; Tell!</h3>

  <p>Open source show and tell is a half day event for developers to share, talk, and learn about cool open source projects. The event will be an opportunity for developers to share their own projects, discover new projects they can contribute to, and better understand the world of open source. Speakers and contributors will cover a variety of projects and content; from open sourcing internal tools, building a community and finding contributors, solving problems, and contribution etiquette. </p>

  <pre>Here's the agenda:</pre>

  <h3>
  <a name="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Agenda</h3>

  <b>Welcome and Announcements</b>: 5-10 minutes to say hi and set the tone.
  <p>(Please review the Code of Conduct below.)</p>
  <p><b>Show & Tell</b>: We usually setup a number of 15 min talks that have 5 minuetes of Q&A after and leave some time for lightening talks near the end. The 20 min time blocks will require the presenter to put in some planning, but the lightening talks can be 2 to 5 min and don't necessarily require any planning.</p>
  <p><b>Workshop (optional)</b>: Dig into some code! We recommend 30 minutes.</p>
  <p><b>Keynote (optional)</b>: Have an extra interesting topic or speaker that might want to close out the event?</p>
  <p><b>Refreshments</b>: Hang out and get to know some people, it's a PARTY!</p>

  <a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Playbook</h3>

  <p><b>Step One: Pick a date and find a location.</b></p>

  <p>Try and partner with a company or two that are very active open source contributors. You'll have some great content as a base and will be able to get some help with promotion.</p>

  <p><b>Step Two: Find people to present what they are working on.</b></p>

  <p>The project they present can be a personal project or something large-scale.</p>

  <p>For new open source contributors, smaller-scale projects can be less intimidating, since they won't need to ramp up on the codebase as much. Focusing on smaller-scale projects can be especially helpful if your event is language-agnostic.</p>

  <p><b>Step Three: Find someone to give a workshop or present a keynote.</b><br><i>This could be an opportunity for attendees to get their hands dirty!</i></p>

  <p>The workshop could be setting up local dev environments to get the ball rolling, contributing to something together, doing pairing sessions, or brainstorming new projects. The sky is the limit here, but it's really important that people come out of this feeling like they learned something!</p>

  <p>If you followed the first tip this should be easy. :) It's almost guaranteed that a company that's involved in open source projects has a workshop pre-fabbed and ready to roll. Setting up a good workshop can take a fair amount of work, so if you don't have someone that already has something ready to go, pair programming can be a great option.</p>

  <p><b>Step Four: Buy some beer.</b></p>

  <p>Programmers will drink cheep beer... but they prefer something tasty. Make sure you have non-alcoholic selections too, since not all programmers drink (or are old enough to)!</p>

  <p><b>Step Five: Promote like crazy.</b></p>

  <p>Most programmers hang out on Twitter. Tweet about your awesome event! Meetups can be a good resource too; there are a lot of programming meetups out there. Eventbrite is useful as well, since it links to social media and gives you a rough headcount.</p>

  <p>Don't forget about IRC! Talk up your event on open source channels, language-specific channels, city-specific channels, et cetera.</p>

  <p>Make sure to ask other open source advocates and companies to promote as well! It can be a really big help to tap other networks.</p>
